                     These values are shown through her art and gives the page just a little bit of emotional impact that appeals to the
                      viewer, It's a cute quote ;p -->

                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p> Savannah Saturn is a visual artist based in Los Angeles. Growing up around the east coast, Savannah
                    had wanted nothing more than to be an artist and that dream has grown and manifested into a
                    colourful reality. Savannah had drawn all her life and since 2015 posted her art to social media.
                    The bright, loud and psychedelic patterns that waved and swayed across her pages captivated the
                    attention of many, gaining an ever-growing following since .
                    <br> <br>
                    These illustrations aren’t just confined to a canvas though, Savannah’s illustrated masterpieces
                    know no bounds, with her doodling and painting on almost anything. Murals, shoes, skateboards,
                    whatever you can think of, Savannah can add her own psychedelic touch. With collaborations with
                    brands such as Gilson and Lazybones as well as doing work for big names such as JoJo Siwa,
                    Trippydraws continues to make the community a brighter place.
